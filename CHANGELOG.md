# Changelog

All notable changes to PixelBridge. Loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/);
versions map to git tags and GitHub releases. I'll try to keep DieselBridge and PixelBridge changes seperate.

## DieselBridge

### 1.0.0-dev.21

- Completed the public logical sensor read and bounded sensor matrix milestone.
- Added direct on-watch sensor diagnostics with shared platform routing.
- Build details expose CI, commit, timestamp, and installation state for this artifact.

## [1.0.1]

The first (true) release of DieselBridge! It mostly changed branding to DieselBridge, but mainly, it made it compatible with WearOS 2 (Android 9).

## [1.0.2 & 3]

Now the app is signed with a **release** key instead of a debug key, so you'll have to uninstall DieselBridge for it to install this update. It changed some more of the branding, and now instead of the device showing up as "bandle.Js DieselBridge" it'll show up as "Bandle.js <Device name>". Also some other stuff, check commits.

## PixelBridge

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-27

First public release. A standalone Wear OS app for the 1st-gen Google Pixel Watch that displays and
acts on Android phone notifications over a **direct BLE link**, driven by **unmodified Gadgetbridge** —
**no Google Play Services, no Wearable Data Layer, no Pixel Watch companion app.**

### Notifications
- Phone notifications appear on the watch as native cards (with vibration) and in an in-app list;
  scroll with the rotary crown.
- Act on them from the wrist: **Reply** (voice/keyboard, or a canned quick-reply synced from the
  phone; shown only when the notification is replyable), **Dismiss**, and **Clear all** — all applied
  on the phone via Gadgetbridge.

### Watch ↔ phone
- **Battery level** and a **version handshake** reported to Gadgetbridge.
- **Find-my-watch** — a full-screen alarm with sound + vibration (rings even under Do-Not-Disturb),
  and a **Find phone** button that rings the phone.
- **Incoming-call screen** — Answer / Decline for incoming calls, End for an ongoing one; the phone
  handles the call audio, the watch is the remote.
- **Music control** — a now-playing card with transport (⏮ ▶/⏸ ⏭) and volume.

### Wear OS Tiles
- A **notifications** tile (a count + the latest few, with an Open button) and a **music** tile
  (now-playing + transport + volume rows) — built on androidx tiles/protolayout Material 3, no GMS.

### Under the hood
- Inbound text decoded as ISO-8859-1 to match Gadgetbridge's Bangle.js UART (umlauts etc. render
  correctly).
- All GATT operations serialized through a single queue for reliability.
- JVM unit tests, an instrumented Compose UI test, and a Wear OS 5.1 emulator setup.
