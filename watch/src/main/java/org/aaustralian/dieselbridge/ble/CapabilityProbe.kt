/**
 * The single load-bearing check for the whole primary topology (see README.md):
 * can THIS watch act as a BLE peripheral / advertiser?
 *
 * The authoritative test is `getBluetoothLeAdvertiser() != null` PLUS actually starting to
 * advertise + open a GATT server (done by [BlePeripheralController]). Do NOT gate on
 * `isMultipleAdvertisementSupported()` — it only reports whether *concurrent* advertisements are
 * possible and is famously ambiguous.
